<li>
  <b>Sales Territory Planning:</b> Strategically divide customer locations among sales reps using proximity as the baseline. Optimize outreach without the complexity of road-based routing.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Healthcare Access Mapping:</b> Link patients or population centers to the closest clinics using raw distance. Support outreach initiatives and equitable care distribution.

<li>
  <b>Utility Zone Planning:</b> Match service requests to the closest operational hubs. Prioritize based on proximity, especially effective for new developments or rural infrastructure projects.
</li>
<li>
  <b>School Catchment Estimation:</b> Determine which school is closest to each student pickup area to draft potential routes or zonesâ€”perfect for early-stage planning before committing to road-based logistics.
</li>

</li>
<li>
  <b>Event Zone Coordination:</b> Quickly allocate staff, checkpoints, or gear to the closest site within large events or festivals. Streamline movement using straight-line assignments, not traffic estimates.
