# üö© MappedTogether

**MappedTogether** is a user-friendly web app for calculating distances between two sets of locations (bases and subbases) using either latitude/longitude coordinates or address-based geocoding. Visualize your data on an interactive map, find the closest base for each subbase, and export your results‚Äîall in your browser!

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **CSV Uploads:** Easily upload Base and Subbase CSV files with coordinates or addresses.
- **Flexible Input:** Use latitude/longitude or addresses (with HERE API geocoding).
- **Smart Distance Calculation:** Computes the full distance matrix between all bases and subbases.
- **Find Closest Bases:** Instantly identify the nearest base for each subbase.
- **Interactive Map:** Visualize all points and connections on a beautiful Leaflet map.
- **Export Results:** Download your closest base results as a CSV file.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. **Open `index.html`** in your browser.
3. **Upload CSV Files:**
    - **Coordinates:** Columns should be `Name,Latitude,Longitude`
    - **Addresses:** Columns should include `Name` and `Address` (optionally `City`, `State`, `Zip`)
4. **Select Input Type** (coordinates or address).
5. **Click "Calculate Distances"** to compute the distance matrix.
6. **Click "Find Closest Bases"** to see the closest base for each subbase.
7. **View Results** in the table and on the map.
8. **Export** results as CSV if needed.
